nesbi
=======
Nesbi (Network Scan, Build and Import data) is a python-library which gives the possibility to scan defined network-ranges for network-devices, read out facts of them, build structured data and import them to a cmdb. At the moment the only supported cmdb is nsot.
The heart of nesbi is a config-file which makes it very flexible and generic.

How it works
=======
##### Nesbi is based on
* [napalm](https://github.com/napalm-automation/napalm)
* [nsot](https://github.com/dropbox/nsot)
* [nelsnmp](https://github.com/networklore/nelsnmp)

##### The following procedure is running with multiple threads per given network/location
1. network-range gets scanned with multiple threads for opened ports (=nesbi_port_scan variable)
2. reachable devices get scanned with nelsnmp to find out the device OS
3. napalm scans the device to get facts
4. dictionary/data for nsot-import gets built
5. data gets imported into nsot

##### Supported napalm-facts
All facts that are collected by the following napalm-functions are supported ([napalm documentation](https://napalm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/base.html)):
* get_facts()
* get_interfaces()
* get_interfaces_ip()
* get_snmp_information()

Installing nesbi
=======
```
$ pip install nesbi
```

##### Requirements
Requirements are defined in: [requirements.txt](requirements.txt).
Nesbi needs at least python 3.6 and doesn't support earlier versions.

Configuring nesbi
=======
### Defining the config
The very first step is defining the config file. The file contains of different parts.

##### cmdb-attributes
attribute-name | purpose 
--------------- | --------------- 
networks | *contains name, range and static key/value pairs which should be added to cmdb*
types | *map device-model dependent variables to cmdb attributes. Given model-name has to match the model-fact which gets read out by napalm.*
attr_functions | *map return-values of functions to cmdb attributes*
napalm | *map napalm variables to cmdb attributes*

attr_functions have to be: defined in config + python code and given as function argument when calling Nesbi().

If you need to exclude addresses (e.g. when using HSRP for high availability of gateway addresses) you can set the **exclude** attribute. It has to contain a list of IPv4 addresses. Network- and broadcast-addresses are excluded by default (for networks greater than /31).
It is possible to scan a single IP when defining the network-range with a **/32** subnet-mask.

##### application-attributes
Application-attributes can be given in the config file, as environment-variables (UPPER-CASE) or as function-arguments when calling nesbi(). Only attributes which have no default value and are required for nesbi to work correctly are marked as required.
**The variables get overwritten in the following order: Nesbi() > config > ENV > default**.

attribute-name | required | default |Â description 
-------------- | --------------- | --------------- | ---------------
nsot_url | yes | *not defined* | /
nsot_email | yes/no | *not defined* | required when using nsot_secret_key as nsot auth method
nsot_secret_key | yes/no | *not defined* | required when using nsot_secret_key as nsot auth method
nsot_auth_header | yes/no | X-NSoT-Email | required when using auth_header as nsot auth method
nsot_site_id | no | 1 | /
nsot_delete_objects | no | False | if set to True existing nsot-objects will be deleted before adding them
nesbi_username | yes | *not defined* | username for napalm
nesbi_password | yes | *not defined* | password for napalm
nesbi_snmp_version | yes | 2c | only v2c is supported at the moment
nesbi_snmp_community | yes | *not defined* | snmp community with read rights
nesbi_scan_ports | no | [22] | tcp-ports which should be scanned to get reachable network devices
nesbi_dry_run | no | False | if set to True nothing will be changed in the cmdb
nesbi_logging_level | no | info | valid log-levels are *notset, debug, info, warning, error, critical*
nesbi_logging_file | no | nesbi.log | custom log file name. If set to False no log file will be generated
nesbi_logging_to_stdout | no | False | /
nesbi_thread_limit | no | 5 | limits maximum parallel running threads

##### config example
[config.yml](examples/config.yml)

Using nesbi
=======
nesbi is a library which has to be used in pure python. As soon as your config-file is ready you can do something like:
[nesbi-example.py](examples/nesbi-example.py) and execute it:
```
python3 nesbi-example.py
```

Logging
=======
Nesbi uses the [logging-module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html) of the python standard-library. By default **nesbi_logging_file** is set to *nesbi.log* and the **nesbi_logging_level** is set to *info*. This will generate the log-file in the directory from where you run the python-script.
